    "## RQs\n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ1: What are the pathways to an ASD diagnosis and support for children and young people in Bradford and how do they differ by ethnicity and SEP? \n",
    "    * RQ1.A) What is the demographic makeup of the children and young people who received an Autism diagnosis in Bradford between X and X? \n",
    "    * RQ1.B) Do referral and diagnosis rates differ across different areas of Bradford? If so, what factors might explain the variations?\n",
    "    * RQ1.C) How does the pathway differ by ethnicity and SES? \n",
    "    * RQ1.D) What other factors seem to influence the pathway?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demographics at time of diagnosis – age, ethnicity, gender, SEP (household income by postcode and/or maternal education level), coexisting diagnoses e.g. ADHD, LD etc. \n",
    "* Age of first record of service involvement and which service(s)\n",
    "* Age at first referral to CAMHS or paediatrics and referral source\n",
    "* Number of services involved between referral and diagnosis (ideally also nature of involvement/intervention e.g. child protection plan, SAL therapy input etc.)\n",
    "* The above 3 factors by ethnicity and SEP and then both ethnicity and SEP combined \n",
    "* The date of first referral for an Autism diagnostic assessment for those identified with an Autism diagnosis (this should hopefully be logged by GPs if not by services, so there should be an identifiable date on the system)\n",
    "* The age the identified children were when the first referral for an Autism assessment was made\n",
    "* Average age of diagnosis and the demographics Leanne asked for in the email below (gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity) AND:\n",
    "* home location (postcode would be fine – just would like to see district differences)\n",
    "* presence of any additional diagnosis e.g. mental health difficulty, physical health condition, learning disability, learning difficulty etc.)\n",
    "* Whether they are classed as looked after by the local authority (i.e. foster care, kinship arrangement etc). or currently/previously on a child in need or child protection plan\n",
    "* Any past and current involvement of other services e.g. CAMHS, Speech and language, social care etc., - it would be good to look at involvement of services pre-referral, between referral and assessment, and post diagnosis\n",
    "* Whether the child is currently on an EHCP and the date this was started in relation to the diagnostic assessment \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the whole cohort and also for those currently 0-25 years old): Average age of autism diagnosis by: Gender, Ethnicity, Socio-economic status, Presence of an intellectual disability. It would also be helpful to know the interaction of the above the factors in terms of their impact on average age of autism diagnosis.\n",
    "* Multiple logistic regressions to explore unique effect of multiple independent variables (in this case SES, ethnicity etc.) on a single dependent/outcome variable (ASD diagnosis, age of diagnosis etc.), whilst accounting for all other explanatory variables, and examination of the interactions between these variables\n",
    "* A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to explore the relationships between the observed variables, and to identify combinations of factors that frequently occur together to affect the outcome (age at diagnosis)"
